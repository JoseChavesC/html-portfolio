<p>One of the best movies about spiderman where the story is totally incredible. In addition to the work that the film has behind it, where they lasted about 5 years to make it.where they bring too many universes together and stories of all spiderman</p>
<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>

<P>This movie is one of the best Batman adaptations on the big screen, not only because of the incredible production it had but also because of the costumes and the incredible actor that Bale is. Besides that the villain is the joker and the actor's performance is incredible.</P>
<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</h3>

<P>Maybe it's not one of the best movies, but for me it's incredible because it's about a person who goes from being in an office to traveling and discovering how beautiful the world is. One of the things that I like the most are the landscapes that the film presents throughout the entire time.<br/>
Amazing</P>
